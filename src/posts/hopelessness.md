we live in a world that doesn't care about us<br />
in a universe that doesn't care about us<br />
filled with people who don't care about us<br />
making things worse for the few that do

every day it seems like we've hit rock bottom<br />
and every day we're proven wrong

how am i supposed to be hopeful<br />
that things will get better<br />
that someday i will be heard<br />
that someday we will be seen

people tell me that it's going to be okay<br />
that things *will* get better, eventually<br />
but i look outside and i see disagreement turned to hatred turned to violence<br />
and i wonder if we'll even make it that far

the universe may not care<br />
but i do<br />
and i don't want to lose what little we have
