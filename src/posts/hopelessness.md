we live in a world that doesn't care about us 
in a universe that doesn't care about us
filled with people that don't care about us
making things worse for the few that do

every day it seems like we've hit rock bottom
and every day we're proven wrong

how am i supposed to be hopeful
that things will get better
that someday i will be heard
that someday we will be seen

people tell me that it's going to be okay
that things *will* get better, eventually
but i look outside and i see disagreement turned to hatred turned to violence
and i wonder if we'll even make it that far

the universe may not care
but i do
and i don't want to lose what little we have
