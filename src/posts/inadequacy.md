I feel stuck.

Recently, I started learning [ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), a scripting language for creating interactive stories.

I really, really, want to write something that's meaningful.
But I realized that I don't know how to come up with something meaningful, or how to actually express it.

I stare at my screen at an empty page for hours until my head hurts and I feel helpless and inadequate and completely, totally stuck. I see all this media that I love, that I look up to and that I'm inspired by and I want to make something as good as these things that I love but I don't know how to.

And it feels terrible, to be stuck in a place like that. I need to get unstuck but I'm also busy with school now and I just don't know what the fuck I should do.
