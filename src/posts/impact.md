I just wanna make stuff<br />
make something cool<br />
interesting<br />
thoughtful<br />
fun

and I have so many ideas<br />
of things I wanna make<br />
and I start on them<br />
and everything is perfect<br />
I'm having fun<br />
doing something meaningful<br />
feeling productive

and then<br />

I have another idea<br />
and this idea<br />
well I wanna make it more<br />
so I start on it<br />
and everything is perfect<br />
I'm having fun<br />
doing something meaningful<br />
feeling productive

and then<br />

I have another idea<br />
and this idea<br />
well I wanna make it more<br />
so I start on it<br />
and everything is pretty good<br />
I'm having fun<br />
doing something meaningful<br />
but the two unfinished things weigh on me<br />
I begin to lose motivation<br />
I'm never gonna finish this project either<br />
so why should I even try?

I'm stuck in a loop<br />
a cycle<br />
and I don't know how to break out

My ADHD prevents me from staying interested in a project for longer than a week<br />
But I have big dreams!<br />
I wanna make big stuff!<br />
I WANT TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THE WORLD<br />
I WANT TO HAVE HAD AN IMPACT<br />
I WANT TO LOOK BACK AND HAVE SOMETHING I'M GENUINELY PROUD OF<br />
LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE<br />
MAKING STUFF THAT CHANGES THE WORLD<br />
THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON ME<br />
THAT THEY ARE PROUD OF

and then there's me.<br />
a website with an empty projects section.<br />
one small experiment.<br />
tens of incomplete github repos.<br />
way more projects that i haven't bothered putting online.

how do i stop this?<br />
how do i make stuff i'm proud of?<br />
how do i break out of the loop?
